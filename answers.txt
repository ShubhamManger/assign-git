• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
• Why should you have different branches?
• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

1) A gitognore file is the one where the file extensions that are in the working space but are not intented for source control.
 It will include *.class file for a Java project.
 
2)  When merging one branch to another without any conflicts it is said to be fast forwarded.

3) We should different branches so that an individual can work locally and after completing his/her work
he/she can upload it to git so that other people on the project can review it and use it for development.

4) Number of Git repositories depends upon that particular project.
